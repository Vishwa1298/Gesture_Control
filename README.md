# Gesture_Control
A Python app that uses hand gestures (thumbs up) to control an image viewer and capture photos via webcam using MediaPipe and OpenCV.
# ✋🖼️ Gesture-Controlled Image Capture Application

This project is a **Python-based computer vision application** that uses **hand gestures** to control image viewing and capture functionality via webcam. Built using **OpenCV** and **MediaPipe**, the application allows users to:

- Navigate through a gallery of images
- Automatically detect a 👍 thumbs-up gesture
- Capture and save the current image when the gesture is detected

## 📷 Features

- ✅ Real-time webcam feed with hand tracking
- ✅ Gesture recognition (thumbs up)
- ✅ Image gallery navigation
- ✅ Automatic screenshot/capture when thumbs-up is shown
- ✅ Saves captured images to a local folder
- ✅ Cooldown mechanism to avoid repeated captures

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 3.10+  
- OpenCV  
- MediaPipe (for hand landmark detection)  
- Deques and dataclasses for efficient data handling  
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
